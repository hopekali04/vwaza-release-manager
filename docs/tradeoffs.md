A common occurence during this 1 week period was trying to make sure that all the fundamental 

Ops: basic logging/metrics, no rate-limit tuning per endpoint, and env setup is manual.

Writing documentation fully was an issue too since that requires a lot of time, so most of the docs we auto generated and I was mainly focused on reviewing if they actuatlly reflect what has been done

Adding great UX features like toasts and graceful error handling was mostly done at the end of the week period because of the primary focus on the backend

Had a lot of issues with making sure the C.I was successful, till now some parts are failing but locally they are building, but since it wasn't a core requirement it had less priority...
